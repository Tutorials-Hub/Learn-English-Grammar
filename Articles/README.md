`                                                             `**Articles (‘the’ and ‘a’/’an’)**

Articles are words that identify a noun as being specific or unspecific. Consider the following examples:

**Example:** *After **the** long day, **the** cup of tea tasted particularly good.*

By using the article *the*, we’ve shown that it was one specific day that was long and one specific cup of tea that tasted good.

**Example:** *After **a** long day, **a** cup of tea tastes particularly good.*

By using the article *a*, we’ve created a general statement, implying that any cup of tea would taste good after any long day.

**Articles are of two types:**

**The definite article** 

**The indefinite article**

1. ***The definite article:*** The definite article is the word ‘the’. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing. For example, your friend might ask, “Are you going to **the** party this weekend?” The definite article tells you that your friend is referring to a specific party that both of you already know about. The definite article can be used with singular, plural, or uncountable nouns. Below are some examples of the definite article, *the*, used in context:

`              `**Example:** *Please give me **the** hammer.*

`             `**Example:** *Please give me **the** red hammer; **the** blue one is too small.*

`             `**Example:** *Please give me **the** nails.*

`             `**Example:** *Please give me **the** large nail; it’s **the** only one strong enough to hold this painting.*

`             `**Example:** *Please give me **the** hammer and **the** nails.*

1. ***The indefinite article:*** The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word ‘*a* ‘when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. It’s the word ‘*an*’ when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea or category of a thing rather than a specific thing. 

For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring **a** gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item. “I am going to bring **an** apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a particular apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article appears only with singular nouns. Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:

**Example:** *Please hand me **a** book; any book will do.*

**Example:** *Please hand me **an** autobiography; any autobiography will do.*

**Exceptions: using *a* or *an***

There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using *a* before words that start with consonants and *an* before words that begin with vowels. The first letter of the word *honor*, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced. Despite its spelling, the word *honor* begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use *an*. Consider the example sentence below for an illustration of this concept.

*My mother is **a** honest woman.*

*My mother is **an** honest woman.*

Similarly, when the first letter of a word is a vowel but is pronounced with a consonant sound, use *a*, as in the sample sentence below:

*She is **an** United States senator.*

*She is **a** United States senator.*

This holds true for acronyms and initialisms too: **an** LCD display, **a** UK-based company, **an** HR department, **a** URL.
