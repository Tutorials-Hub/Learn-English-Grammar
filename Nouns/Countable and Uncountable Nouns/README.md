**What is a countable noun:**

A countable noun, as the name suggests, refers to nouns that can literally be counted. The number or quantity of countable nouns can be quoted exactly. To identify if a noun is countable, you can ask the question ‘how many.’

` `A countable noun is “a noun that has singular and plural forms. In the plural, countable nouns usually add an ‘s’ or ‘es’, for example ‘mistakes’, ‘problems’, and ‘buses’. When it is singular, a countable noun usually comes after a determiner such as ‘a’, ‘this’, ‘any’, or ‘a lot of’, for example ‘this house, ‘a week’, and ‘the way’.”

A countable noun is also defined as “a noun that forms a plural and is used with a numeral, with words such as many or few, or with the indefinite article a or an.”

**List of Countable Nouns**

Here is a list of a few countable nouns and its plural forms for your reference.

|Shoe|Shoes|Hand|Hands|
|Book|Books|Umbrella|Umbrellas|
|Aeroplane|Aeroplanes|Computer|Computers|
|Glass|Glasses|Apple|Apples|
|Coconut tree|Coconut trees|Bottle|Bottles|

**What is an uncountable noun:**

Any noun that cannot be counted can be classified as an uncountable noun. Nouns like water, rice, oil, etc. belong to this category. Unlike countable nouns, uncountable nouns do not have a plural form. If the noun in a sentence does not have a specific quantity and answers the question ‘how much’, then it can be considered an uncountable noun.

An uncountable noun is “a noun that has no plural form” and also those that “usually refer to abstract things such as ‘advice’, ‘luck’, and ‘information’, or to substances such as ‘milk’, ‘blood’, and ‘smoke’.” Furthermore, “a noun such as ‘gold’, ‘information’, or ‘furniture’ which has only one form and can be used without a determiner” is classified as an uncountable noun.

## **Using Countable Nouns and Uncountable Nouns in Sentences:**
Once you know what countable and uncountable nouns are, the next step is to learn how to use them in sentences. There is just one fact that makes the usage of countable and uncountable nouns different from each other. Countable nouns are always used with a determiner. Determiners include articles (a, an, the) and quantitative adjectives such as a number, collective nouns that indicate a particular number such as a dozen (12), a pair (2), a score (20), a baker’s dozen (13), etc. and words like a few, lots of, a number of, etc. On the other hand, uncountable nouns can appear with or without a determiner as there is no specific number being referred to. However, there are instances where you can combine an uncountable noun with a countable noun to indicate the exact quantity of the particular noun.

Let us look at a few examples of both countable and uncountable nouns and the different ways in which they are used in sentences.
## Examples of Countable and Uncountable Nouns
First, let us look at how countable nouns work.

- I have *a dog.*
- My mom bought *half a kilo of oranges and apples* on her way to visit my grandmother in *the hospital*.
- I had to pick up *two of my friends* on the way.
- Banu found *a few books* that could help our research.
- Jason bought *a dozen eggs*.

Let us now check how uncountable nouns are used in sentences.

- Would you like to have *some milk* before you go to bed?
- Firoz asked his son to throw out *the garbage* before he went to college.
- Sanu had *blood* on her hand; nobody including her knew what had happened.
- Is there *any water* left in the jug?
- We were asked to collect *information* about the new education policy before noon.

As already mentioned, uncountable nouns can be combined with countable nouns at times. Let us look at some examples to see how it can be done.

- The doctor has asked me to drink at least *eight glasses of water* a day.
- We had only *two packets of oil* left.
- I guess I added *an extra teaspoon of sugar* to it.
- Veronica needed *one more piece of equipment* to work on her project.
