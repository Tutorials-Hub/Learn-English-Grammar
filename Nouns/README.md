Nouns are a part of speech that comprise words that are used to name people, places, animals, objects and ideas. Almost every sentence will definitely have a noun, and they perform different roles in a sentence. Nouns can act as the subject, an indirect object, a direct object, a subject complement and an object complement. Nouns can also function as adjectives and verbs.

**Examples of Nouns:**

- **People** – Rahul, Sheela, Man, Person, Tommy, Women, Girl, The Prime Minister
- **Places** – Bangalore, India, Mexico, North Pole, South Africa, The Nile River, Classroom, Bedroom, Basketball Court, Cricket Ground, Swimming Pool
- **Animals/Birds/Aquatic Animals/Reptiles** – Lion, Zebra, Snake, Ostrich, Flamingo, Bear, Cat, Fish, Shark
- **Ideas** – Evolution, Invention, Extinction, Argument, Destruction
- **Objects/Things** – Bat, Cycle, Curtains, Paper, Bag, Blackboard, Cupboard

**Types of Nouns**

Nouns can be broadly classified into:

1\. **Proper Nouns:** Nouns that are used to name a person, place or thing specifically are called a proper noun. Proper nouns always begin with a capital letter.

**Examples:**

1. My name is **Rose**. (Name of a particular person)
1. This is my dog, **Bruno**. (Name of a specific pet animal owned by someone)
1. David came back from **Minsk**. (Name of a specific place)
1. **Louis Philippe** is a famous brand of men’s clothing. (Name of a particular clothing brand)

2\. **Common Nouns:** Common nouns are those nouns that refer to a generic item, group or place. This means that, unlike proper nouns, they are not used to identify specific people, places or objects. Common nouns are not capitalised unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence.

**Examples:**

1. I bought a **pen** yesterday. (Common object)
1. I am going to **school**. (Common place)
1. Only ten **employees** showed up to work today. (Common group)
1. The **car** is out of **fuel**. (Common items)

3\. **Singular Nouns:** These are words that are used to name a single person, place, animal, bird or object.

**Examples:**

1. There is a little **boy** in front of our house. (Single person)
1. That is my **daughter**. (Single person)
1. I found a wounded **sparrow** in the bush. (Single bird)
1. A red **van** has been following us for a long time. (Single object)

4\. **Plural Nouns:** Plural nouns refer to a number of people, places, animals or things. Nouns are made plural by adding an ‘s’ or ‘es’ or ‘ies’ or ‘ves’ to the existing root word. Nouns that end with an ‘s’ remain the same. Some nouns remain the same in both their singular and plural forms, and some others have totally different spelling.

**Examples:**

1. I need some **apples**.
1. Did you find the **boxes** you were looking for?
1. I bought **mangoes** from the market.
1. We took photos of some **deer** on our way.

5\.**Countable Nouns**: are those nouns that can be counted or measured.

**Examples:**

1. Tom brought **ten packets of lays** for the trip. (specific number – ten)
1. Mom asked me to buy **a dozen eggs**. (specific – dozen means twelve)
1. I saw **an aeroplane** around seven in the morning. (specific – an means one)

6\. Uncountable Noun: are those nouns that cannot be counted. This category of nouns includes both concrete and abstract nouns.

**Examples:**

1. I have **a lot of homework** to do. (Not specific)
1. I have a **cup of tea**. (Cannot count)
1. We are facing terrible **weather** today. (Cannot count)

7\. **Collective Nouns:** A collective noun is a naming word that is used to denote a group of objects, animals or people.

**Examples:**

1. Collective nouns for groups of animals
