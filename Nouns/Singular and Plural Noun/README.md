`                                                                 `**Singular and Plural Nouns**

All nouns represent people, places, things, or ideas. If the noun describes only one of these, such as one person or one place, then it’s a singular noun. If it describes more than one, such as two people or multiple places, then it’s a plural noun. 

Singular nouns are the standard form of nouns, so you don’t have to add anything to make a noun singular. Plural nouns, however, are usually formed by adding an –*s* or *-es* to the end of a singular noun. Be careful, though, because a lot of irregular plural nouns don’t follow this rule.

**Regular nouns**

Most singular nouns form the plural by adding **-s**
##### **Examples:**

|**Singular**|**Plural**|
| :- | :- |
|Boat|Boats|
|House|Houses|
|Cat|Cats|
|River|Rivers|







A singular noun ending in **s, x, z, ch, sh** makes the plural by adding**-es**.
##### **Examples**

|**Singular**|**Plural**|
| :- | :- |
|Bus|Buses|
|Wish|Wishes|
|Pitch|Pitches|
|Box|Boxes|

A singular noun ending in a consonant and then **y** makes the plural by dropping the y and adding**-ies**.
##### **Examples**

|**Singular**|**Plural**|
| :- | :- |
|Penny|pennies|
|Spy|Spies|
|Baby|Babies|
|City|Cities|
|Daisy|Daisies|
