`                                                                    `**Preposition of Time**

The main prepositions of time are at, in, and, on. Below, we'll describe how they are generally used:

- **At:** We use 'at' for specific time points.
- **In:** This preposition is applicable for longer periods, such as months, seasons, years, or times of day (except for night).
- **On:** It is used for specific days, dates, and holidays.

**Understanding the Usage of 'At', 'In', and 'On'**

**Usage of Preposition 'At'**

We generally use 'at' in the context of specific times on the clock, time of events, and with the word 'night'. Let's examine some examples:

- I will meet you at 5pm.
- The meeting is scheduled at 10:30 am.
- She goes to the gym at night.
- The event starts at dusk.
- We arrived at midnight.

**Usage of Preposition 'In'**

This preposition is typically used when referring to periods that will last for some time. It's also used with parts of the day, years, seasons, and months. Take a look at these examples:

- We swim in the morning.
- The flowers bloom in spring.
- They will visit us in December.
- I was born in 1985.
- We'll go for a vacation in the summer.
- The conference is in two weeks.

**Usage of Preposition 'On'**

We tend to use 'on' with particular days, dates, and holidays. Here are some examples to illustrate this:

- They are coming on Monday.
- His birthday is on the 20th of June.
- We had a barbecue on Independence Day.
- I have a meeting on Christmas day.

**Beyond 'At', 'In', and 'On': Other Prepositions of Time**

While 'at', 'in', and 'on' are commonly used prepositions of time, there are others, such as 'during', 'for', 'since', 'by', 'till/until', and 'from…to'. These can help express a more complex relationship in time:

- **During:** This preposition expresses 'throughout the period of' or 'at some time in'. For example, "I snuck out during the meeting."
- **For:** It is used to express a duration of time. For instance, "He studied for three hours."
- **Since:** We use 'since' to represent the start of a period up to now. For example, "I haven't seen her since Easter."
- **By:** This preposition marks a deadline. For instance, "I will finish the project by Friday."
- **Till/Until:** These two express how long a situation continues. For example, "She will be on leave until July."
- **From…to:** These denote the beginning and end of a period. For instance, "The store is open from 9am to 5pm."
