## **Points to Remember When Using the Future Perfect Tense**
Always keep in mind that the future perfect tense can be formed using two auxiliary verbs (will and have) followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example, They *will have reached* the station by eight in the morning. Also, as you know, the past participle form of the verb can be formed by adding ‘ed’ to the end of the verb. However, this is not always the case. Irregular verbs take different spelling patterns when used as a past participle.
