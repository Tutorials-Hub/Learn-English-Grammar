The future continuous tense is generally used to represent an event or action that is happening at a certain point in time in the future. The tense is also called the future progressive tense, as it denotes an action or event that is progressing or continuing at a particular time in the future.

**Structure and Formula of the Future Continuous Tense**

To have a more detailed idea of the future continuous tense, take a look at the formula and structure of the tense.

The formula of the future continuous tense is as follows:

|Subject + **Helping verbs (will + be) + present participle form of the verb** + the rest of the sentence|
| :- |

Now, analyse the structure of the future continuous tense to see how the sentence structure changes when used as a positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative sentence.

## **Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Future Continuous Tense**
Like the present continuous tense and the past continuous tense, the future continuous tense consists of two helping verbs – ‘will’ and ‘be’ followed by the past participle form of the main verb. The past participle of the main verb can be formed by adding an ‘ing’ to the end of the verb. The tense can be made negative by adding ‘not’ after ‘will’. When used in the interrogative form, the sentence starts with ‘will’ followed by the subject, ‘be’ and the past participle form of the verb.

Furthermore, always keep in mind that the future continuous tense can be used only with action verbs and never with stative verbs. This is mainly because only action verbs can be done for a particular duration. Also, remember that the action mentioned in the future continuous tense would have started earlier but would not have been completed at that particular point in time.
