# Future Tense
Future tense is a grammatical tense used to describe an action, event, or state of being that will occur or exist in the future. In English, the future tense is often formed using the auxiliary verb "will" or "shall," followed by the base form of the main verb. For example, in the sentence "They will arrive tomorrow," "will arrive" is in the future tense, indicating that the arrival is expected to happen in the future.
