## **Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Simple Future Tense**
If you are planning to use the simple future tense, here are a few points that you have to keep in mind. The simple future tense form of the verb should always have two verbs – an auxiliary verb (will) and the base form of the verb. Interrogative sentences start with the helping verb ‘will’ followed by the subject and the base form of the main verb. A negative sentence can be identified by the usage of ‘not’ after the auxiliary verb ‘will’. Remember that the helping verb ‘will’ is what mainly indicates to the reader or listener that the tense used speaks about a future or event that is going to happen in the future.
