## ` `**Rules to be Followed when Using the Past Perfect Continuous Tense**
Similar to the present perfect continuous tense, the past perfect continuous tense also consists of two helping verbs and a main verb. Among the three verbs that represent the tense, the first helping verb should always be ‘had’ followed by ‘been’, which is in turn followed by the present participle of the main verb. This rule holds true when the sentence is a positive sentence. In case you are employing the tense form in an interrogative sentence, the helping verb ‘had’ comes first followed by the subject which is in turn followed by the the helping verb ‘been’ and the present participle of the main verb.

For a negative sentence, ‘not’ is placed after the first auxiliary verb ‘had’ and for a negative interrogative sentence, you can either use the contraction ‘hadn’t’ or place ‘not’ after the subject.
## **Uses of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense**

- To represent an action that started at some point in the past and continued or progressed till a particular time in the recent past.
