The simple past tense, in English, is used to represent an action/event that took place in the past. With many verbs, the simple past tense is formed by adding an ‘ed’ or a ‘d’ to the end of the base verb. However, there are other verbs which behave differently and take different spellings when used in the simple past form.

**Rules and Points to Remember When Using the Simple Past Tense**

When forming a verb in the simple past tense, there are a few points you have to bear in mind.

- **Conjugating regular verbs** – In order to present the main verb in the sentence, you just have to add ‘-ed’ to the end of the regular verb and ‘-d’ to the end of a regular verb which ends with an ‘e’.

For example: Reach – reached, kick – kicked, walk – walked, confess – confessed, work –

worked

Like – liked, introduce – introduced, force – forced, announce – announced,

` notice – noticed

- **Verbs that remain the same –** Some verbs take the same spelling as the base verb and remain the same in the past tense.

For example: Cut – cut, put – put, hurt – hurt, set – set, hit – hit

- **Verbs that take different spelling patterns –**irregular verbs are seen to follow different spelling patterns and there is no rule as such to explain why they are so.

For example: Buy – bought, think – thought, draw – drew, drink – drank, see – saw
