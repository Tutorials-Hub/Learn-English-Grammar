# Present Tense

Present tense is a grammatical tense used to describe an action, event, or state of being that is currently happening or is generally true. In English, the present tense is typically formed by using the base form of the verb (e.g., "walk," "eat," "study") for most subjects. However, for the third person singular (he, she, it), the verb usually takes the suffix "-s" or "-es" (e.g., "walks," "eats," "studies").

There are also other forms of the present tense, such as present continuous (e.g., "is walking," "are eating," "am studying"), which indicate actions that are happening right now, and present perfect (e.g., "has walked," "have eaten," "have studied"), which indicate actions that were completed in the past but have relevance to the present.
