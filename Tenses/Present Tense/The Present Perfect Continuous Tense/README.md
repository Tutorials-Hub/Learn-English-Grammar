The present perfect continuous tense is employed in a sentence to indicate an action that started in the recent past and is still continuing in the present. It is also referred to as the present perfect progressive tense as the action progresses from the past to the present.

The present perfect continuous tense can be formed by following the formula given below.

|Subject + **have/has + been + present participle (verb+ing)** + the rest of the sentence|

Like every other tense, the sentence structure of the present perfect continuous tense can be analysed in its positive, negative, interrogative and negative interrogative kinds of sentences.

## `  `**Points to be Remembered When Using the Present Perfect Continuous Tense**
Similar to the present perfect tense, the present perfect continuous tense also consists of helping verbs and main verbs. The only difference is that instead of one helping verb and one main verb in the past participle form, the present perfect continuous tense uses two helping verbs and a main verb in the present participle form. The helping verbs used are ‘have’ or ‘has’ along with ‘been’. These verbs are followed by the present participle of the main verb, which is formed by adding an ‘ing’ to the base verb.

The other fact that you should remember is that, like the present perfect tense, the helping verbs ‘have’ and ‘has’ are used in accordance with the pronoun or noun used in the sentence.
