## **Rules to be Followed When Using the Present Perfect Tense**
The very first thing that you will have to learn before you start using present perfect tense is how past participles are formed. In the English language a past participle is formed by adding an ‘ed’ to the base form of the verb in most cases. However, there are a number of irregular verbs that have different spellings and do not, in any way, follow the concept of adding ‘ed’ to the base form like regular verbs. 

The next point to remember is that a sentence with the past perfect form of the verb uses two verbs – a helping verb and a main verb. ‘Have’ and ‘has’ are the two helping verbs that are used. ‘Have’ is used when the pronouns ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘they’ or plural nouns act as the subject in a sentence. ‘Has’ is used when the pronouns ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’ or singular nouns act as the subject.

**Uses of the Present Perfect Tense**

The present perfect tense can be used

- To denote an action or event that happened or started in the past and still has its impact or some connection to the subject in the present.
- To indicate an action that happened in the past and continues to occur in the present.
- To connect the events of the present to the events that happened in the past.
