**[The Simple Present Tense]{.underline}**

The **simple present tense** is an English verb tense used to describe
facts and habits, to describe scheduled events in the future, and to
tell stories. Here are two easy examples of each usage:

**(1) Simple present tense to describe facts and habits.**

-   Alan walks the dog every morning.

-   He plays chess.

**(2) Simple present tense to describe scheduled events in the future.**

-   The train arrives at 5 o\'clock.

-   The plane lands in 5 minutes.

**(3) Simple present tense to tell stories (particularly jokes).**

-   Sarah crosses the road and asks the policeman for directions.

> (This use of the simple present tense is quite rare.)

-   A horse walks into a bar, and the barman says, \"why the long
    > face?\"

> (Compare to: A horse walked into a bar, and the barman said, \"why the
> long face?\")

The **simple present tense** is used:

**(1) To describe facts and habits:**

-   I like chocolate. (Fact)

-   Angela runs a youth club full of glue-sniffers. (Fact)

-   I ride horses in the summer. (Fact and habit)

-   It always snows here in January. (Fact and habit)

-   Dawn plays chess in the evenings. (Fact and habit)

(Note: These activities do not have to be happening right now.)\
\
This type of sentence, especially if it\'s describing a habit, will
usually include a time expression like \"always,\" \"every year,\"
\"never,\" \"often,\" \"on Mondays,\" \"rarely,\" \"sometimes,\" or
\"usually.\"

**(2) To describe scheduled events in the future**

-   The train arrives at 5 o\'clock.

-   It is low tide at 0234.

(Yes, we know! It\'s supposed to be the present tense!)

**(3) To tell stories (particularly jokes) to make your listener or
reader feel more engaged with the story.**

-   There are two parrots sitting on a perch. One turns to the other
    > and asks, \"Can you smell fish?\"

-   We heard the helicopter overhead. Suddenly, the radio bursts into
    > life.

(This is sometimes called the fictional present or the historic
present.)

**Forming the Simple Present Tense**

The **simple present tense** is quite easy to form.

**base form**

or

**base form**

 + 

**\"s\"**

Let\'s look at the verb **to run** (whose [[base
form]{.underline}](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/base_form.htm) is **run**).
In the simple present tense, **run** looks like this:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [**[Person]{.underline}**](https://www.grammar-monster.com/glossary/person.htm)   **Example**
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
  First person singular                                                             I run

  Second person singular                                                            You run

  Third person singular                                                             He/She/It **runs**

  First person plural                                                               We run

  Second person plural                                                              You run

  Third person plural                                                               They run
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In other words, it only changes in the third person singular (he / she /
it). It adds either **s**, **es** or **ies**.

**The Negative Version**

To create a negative sentence, use **\"do not\" + \[base form of the
verb\]**. (Use **\"does not\"** with third person singular (he / she /
it).)

**\"do not\" or \"does not\"**

 + 

**\[base form of the verb\]**

-   I do not like chocolate.

-   Angela does not run a youth club full of glue-sniffers.

-   I do not ride horses in the summer.

-   It does not always snow here in January.

-   Dawn does not play chess in the evenings.

In speech and writing (especially informal writing), \"do not\" is often
shortened to \"don\'t,\" and \"does not\" is often shortened to
\"doesn\'t.\" If you want to add some emphasis, use one of the long
versions (i.e., \"do not\" or \"does not\"), and emphasize the word
\"not.\"

a yes/no question:

**\"do\" or \"does\"**
