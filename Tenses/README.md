# Tenses

Tense is a grammatical concept that refers to the time when an action, event, or state of being occurs. In English, there are three primary tenses: past, present, and future. Each of these tenses can be further divided into four aspects: simple, continuous (or progressive), perfect, and perfect continuous. These aspects indicate how the action, event, or state of being relates to the passage of time. For example, in the sentence "She is singing," the tense is present, and the aspect is continuous, indicating that the action is happening right now and is ongoing.
